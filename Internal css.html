            <p>The city of Ahmedabad, the seventh-largest metropolis in India and the largest in the state of Gujarat, was founded in 1411 AD as a walled city on the eastern bank of the river Sabarmati.

                Historically Ahmedabad has been one of the most important centres of trade and commerce in Western India. It is also a major industrial and financial city, contributing about 14% of the total investments in all stock exchanges in India and 60% of the total productivity of the state.
                
                It is home to several scientific and educational institutions of national, regional and global importance. The city has a great architectural tradition reflected in many exquisite monuments, temples and modern buildings. Ahmedabad is the first Indian city to receive UNESCO's World Heritage City status in the year 2017</p>
